# TechProduction_Spring2019_FemaleRoleModelProject

This is the Repo for the CUNY Tech Production, Spring 2019

The class is working with Tja≈°a Ferme on a videogame tie-in to the Female Role Model Project: http://femalerolemodelproject.com/

The goals of this project are to design and iterate on a game that thematically expands on the Role Model Project, and uses Brain Computer Interface (BCI) devices as the means of controlling the game.
